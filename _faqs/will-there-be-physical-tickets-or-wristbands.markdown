answer_text: All tickets will come in the form of a wristband. Stylish! If you purchase
  your ticket closer to the festival and we are unable to ship the wristband to you,
  you will receive instructions on where to pick your wristband up. If you do not
  like instructions, we get it. Rebellion is cool, but if you want to get in, you
  have to play ball.
