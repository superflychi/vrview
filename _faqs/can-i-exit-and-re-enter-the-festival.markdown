answer_text: In general, re-entry is not allowed. You may enter the festival gates
  once each day. However, if you absolutely must leave the festival and need to return
  the same day, you must speak with a supervisor at any festival entrance or exit
  BEFORE LEAVING to be scanned out. Yes, it is as complicated as it sounds. We do
  not recommend it. And, yes, we realize it would be much easier to just tell you
  “no.”
