answer_text: You will receive ONE wristband that grants you access to all three days
  of the festival. It cannot be removed once put on. If security suspects that your
  wristband has been tampered with, it will be void, and you will not be given access
  to the festival. Friendship is not worth missing out on this killer lineup.
